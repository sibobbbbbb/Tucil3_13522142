## Solving the Word Ladder Game Using the UCS Algorithm, Greedy Best First Search, and A*
Word ladder (also known as Doublets, word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, laddergrams, or word golf) is a widely known word game enjoyed by people of all ages. It was introduced by Lewis Carroll, a writer and mathematician, in 1877. In this game, players are presented with two words referred to as the start word and end word. To win the game, players must find a chain of words that can connect the start word to the end word. The number of letters in the start word and end word is always the same. Each word in the word chain must differ by only one letter from the previous word. In this game, an optimal solution is sought, minimizing the number of words included in the word chain. Below is an illustration and the rules of the game.
